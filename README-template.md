## My process

My process was a simple 3 step process:

1. I created all the elements and added their custom styles including the cards.
2. Using Flexbox I set the layout for the larger screens as I am still more comfortable using this method rather than mobile first.
3. I used the media query to set the layout when the screen size falls below most tablet sizes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to to use order in CSS Flexbox in order to position elements in their specific order.
The code below shows the order set for the first and last cards respectively:

```css

#cyan{
    border-color:hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
    order: -1;
}


#blue{
    border-color:hsl(212, 86%, 64%);
    order: 1;
}

```

### Continued development

1. I still want to work on my completion time for my projects. I think I can complete the projects faster with better planning and more consistent work.
2. I want to see if a mobile-first approach is really
